# Pocha Automated Computer Operator (PACO)

Monte Carlo tool to compute optimal betting strategy in the Spanish card game "Pocha".

Given the player hand and upward facing card it simulates the game for a number of different draws to provide an approximation to the statistical distribution for the number of winning tricks for each player at the table. When player choices are involved, it can either pick at random or play for maximum strength/weakness.
